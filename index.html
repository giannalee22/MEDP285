<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Gianna Frusciante-Lee and I'm a junior at Hunter College majoring in media studies with a concentration in emerging medias, and minoring in film. I'm currently full time student, who also works as a part time hostess at a Japanese restaurant. I'm the social media intern for a new startup called Jobreel, as well as a tech-tern for Peter Jackson this semester. I am born and raised in New York City and I love to eat good food, I love to create art, and I love to write. </p>

<h3>Artist Statement</h3>

<p>My art takes multiple forms and I enjoy playing make believe in my writing. It’s crucial for me to have my writing be otherworldly and weird because I want the audience to really think about life, other possibilities, and funky alternative realities/universes. To make my work more personal, oftentimes I’ll add elements of my own life into my stories.</p>

<p>Since 2021, I’ve been writing and constructing a story about my own sleep paralysis experiences, with the inclusion of fictional elements. After completion, I plan to take my story and turn it into a manga and/or an anime. I write short stories that are in the dark fantasy and science fiction realm. I've been drawing digitally for a few years now, using Procreate. I mainly draw manga and anime characters, but this has led me to turn to a more simplistic, and cutesy art style. My latest artistic venture has been working on my Etsy shop, where I sell my artwork in the form of stickers, zines, and more. In the social media aspect, I create video content for my Instagram food blog.</p>
